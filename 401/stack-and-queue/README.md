# Stack and Queue

My implementation of a Stack and Queue in JavaScript with tests to verify the functionality.

## Challenge

Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

## Approach & Efficiency

Seems to be the standard approach for JS.

## API

### Stack

`push`\
Arguments: value\
adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.\

`pop`\
Arguments: none\
Returns: the value from node from the top of the stack\
Removes the node from the top of the stack\
Should raise exception when called on empty stack

`peek`\
Arguments: none\
Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack\
Should raise exception when called on empty stack

`is empty`\
Arguments: none\
Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

### Queue

`enqueue`\
Arguments: value\
adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.

`dequeue`\
Arguments: none\
Returns: the value from node from the front of the queue\
Removes the node from the front of the queue\
Should raise exception when called on empty queue

`peek`\
Arguments: none\
Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue\
Should raise exception when called on empty stack

`is empty`\
Arguments: none\
Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty
