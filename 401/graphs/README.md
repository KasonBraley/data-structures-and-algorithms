# Graphs

## Challenge

Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list.

## API

`addVertex` - Add a node to the graph

`addDirectedEdge` - Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph

`getNeighbors` - Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node

`breadthFirst` - Traverses the graph

`getSize` - Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

`getNodes` - Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)


## Business Trip
Determine whether the trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.

### Approach & Efficiency
Used a loop and conditional logic to determine the relationships of the values in the passed in array.
