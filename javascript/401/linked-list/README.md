# Singly Linked List
My implementation of a Singly Linked List in JavaScript with tests to verify the functionality.

## Challenge
Implement a Node and Linked List class in JS, with tests.

## Approach & Efficiency
Seems to be the standard approach for JS.

## API
`insert` - adds a Node instance to the Linked List

`includes` - searches the Linked List for a specified value

`toString` - returns a string including all the values in the Linked List
